## Overview

A monorepo starter for a NodeJS + React example written in Typescript. Uses Apollo graphql on express with minimal configuration and create-react-app for the React app (can be ejected at your convenience)

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the React app in the development mode. (source files are in {repo_dir}**/src**)<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn server`

Runs the server (source files are in {repo_dir}**/server**)
